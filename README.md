# MetodosNumericos
Various numerical methods programmed in Octave. These are the scripts I used for the Métodos Numéricos course at the Engineering College, UNMdP. 

My idea was to compile everything into a couple of general scripts to organize things a bit better, but I never found the time nor the motivation to do it, so for now it is staying like this. Note that these are all standalone scripts, meaning you cannot invoke them as a function. However, this can be easily solved by adding a couple of lines on each script (if desired).

The [Symbolic Package](https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy) is requited to run a lot of the scripts. I also suggest you to install the [Splines Package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/splines/index.html), at the time I found it very useful to obtain quick results or the verify the ones obtained from the scripts.

If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue or contact me at:
